The issue can be resolved by using `margin: 0;` on the parent element, and using padding on the child instead.  This avoids the extra space added by margins while achieving the desired spacing around the child element:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 0;
}

div > * {
  padding: 10px;
}
```
Alternatively, you can use the `gap` property (if supported by the target browsers) to add space between flex items without affecting the container's size:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 10px;
}
```
