The following CSS code causes an unexpected layout issue in some browsers:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

div > * {
  margin: 10px;
}
```

This code attempts to center a child element within a flex container and adds a margin around it. However, the margin can cause the container to expand beyond its intended size, leading to unexpected spacing issues.
