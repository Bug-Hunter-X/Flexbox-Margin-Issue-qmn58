# Flexbox Margin Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon layout bug that can occur when using flexbox in CSS.  The issue arises from the interaction between the `margin` property on child elements and the `align-items` and `justify-content` properties of the parent flex container.

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS code.  The `bugSolution.css` file offers a solution to resolve the layout issue.

This bug is subtle and can be difficult to diagnose, especially in more complex layouts. This example provides a simplified illustration to highlight the problem and demonstrate a practical solution.
